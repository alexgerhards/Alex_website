#When readmes are written things occur
but are those things good?
in a recent study by the mvrt group (mayan veritable redirection tessolate)
it was proven to be that 99% of readmes are not read by more than 3 million monkeys
given this fact we must increase the volatility of the readme files
set it up so that when a readme file goes unread for more that 15 seconds it begins to cause the computer to
leak battery acid onto the hands of its user
thank you for your consideration
the readmeking
